brabect1's OpenSCAD Models
==========================

This repository hosts collection of OpenSCAD models for 3D printing.

As of May 2025, the respository structure is ad-hoc and will evolve over time.

Square Tube Profile Clamps
--------------------------

These models are intended to create clamps for arbitrary connections of square tube
(aluminium) profiles of varying diameters/dimensions. The main goal is let one create
*crude* frame structures using (simple) square profiles rather than more expensive
T-bit profiles.
